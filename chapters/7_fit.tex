\chapter{Signal extraction}
In this chapter the procedure for signal yield extraction is presented. We use the framework of \texttt{RooFit} \cite{verkerke2006roofit} where we define 2D histogram templates in \vars, based on MC, for signal and several types of background. Using these templates, the independent full sample is fitted with binned extended maximum likelihood (ML) fit, so that the individual template ratios and their sum describe the fitted sample as best as possible. In particle physics we are often dealing with low numbers of events and need to account for the Poisson nature of the data, therefore we use the likelihood fit, since it takes the Poisson errors into account, unlike the $\chi^2$ fit, where the errors are assumed to be Gaussian. In this procedure we attempt to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function, given the observations.

If $P(n\vert\vec \alpha)$ is the probability of measuring $n$ candidates, where $\vec \alpha$ is a set of parameters on which $P$ depends, we can define the likelihood function $L$ for a series of such measurements (i.e., bins in histogram) $n_i$ based on Poisson statistics as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ML}
L(\vec \alpha) = \prod_{i=1} P(n_i|\vec \alpha) = \prod_{i=1} \frac{\mu_i^{n_i}\mathrm{e}^{-\mu_i}}{n_i!},
\end{equation}
where $\mu_i$ is the expected value for each measurement. It is also common to search for the minimum of the negative value of $\ln L$, or negative log-likelihood (NLL), as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:NLL}
\mathcal{L}(\vec \alpha) = -\ln L(\vec \alpha) = -\sum_{i}\ln \left(\frac{\mu_i^{n_i}\mathrm{e}^{-\mu_i}}{n_i!}\right) = \sum_{i}\ln(n_i!) + \mu_i - n_i\ln(\mu_i).
\end{equation}
Maximizing $L$ or minimizing $\mathcal{L}$ gives us a maximum likelihood estimate of the set of parameters $\vec \alpha_{ML}$ which best describe the observed data. 

The ML method provides a method to estimate the fit uncertainty. This is especially useful if the log-likelihood has a non-parabolic shape, which leads to asymmetric errors. We calculate the errors using the \texttt{MINOS} algorithm from the \texttt{MINUIT} package \cite{James:1994vla}, which is implemented in RooFit. The algorithm follows the log-likelihood function out of the minimum to find the appropriate intervals of confidence for each parameter, taking the parameter correlations into account. 

To estimate the goodness of the likelihood fit, one option is to generate toy MC experiments and obtain the expected log-likelihood distribution. Likelihood fits, however, also offer another way to test the goodness of fit via the likelihood ratio (LR), where we compare the likelihood obtained under the ML parameters $\vec\alpha_{ML}$, to the likelihood obtained under the null hypothesis parameters $\vec\alpha_{H_0}$. This determines how likely the data is under one model than the other. We define the LR test as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lr}
\lambda = -2\ln\left(\frac{L(\vec \alpha_{ML})}{L(\vec \alpha_{H_0})}\right) = -2 \left[ \ln L(\vec \alpha_{ML}) - L(\vec \alpha_{H_0})\right] \sim \chi^2_q,
\end{equation}
which asymptotically behaves as the $\chi^2_q$ distribution with $q=m-n$ degrees of freedom, where $m$ and $n$ are degrees of freedom of $L(\vec \alpha_{ML})$ and $L(\vec \alpha_{H_0})$, respectively. In particle physics we usually study a specific decay and try to perform measurements of the signal yield, so the null hypothesis in this case is that we expect to observe no signal. This means that for the null hypothesis we fix the expected signal yield parameter to zero, while leaving the other parameters of $\vec\alpha_{H_0}$ the same as in $\vec\alpha_{ML}$, which results in $n = m-1$ degrees of freedom and in their difference $q = m -n = 1$. For such a simple $LR$ test of a single parameter the LR test then follows the $\chi^2$ distribution with $1$ degree of freedom. In this case we can define the fit significance from the $\chi^2$ value in units of $\sigma$ as
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Significance} = \sqrt{\lambda} = \sqrt{\chi^2}.
\end{equation}

\section{Fit Setup}
We perform 10 fits to each stream of MC, where 9 streams were used for the creation of the templates and the remaining stream was used as fitted data. When fitting real data, all available MC was used for creating the templates. The full signal MC sample was used for the signal template definition in case of MC as well as data fits. The signal part of the \texttt{ulnu} sample was not used in template construction, it was only used as a part of the fitted sample. 

The same MC samples are used for template construction as described in Chapter \ref{sec:data-and-monte-carlo-samples},
\begin{itemize}
\item signal MC,
\item 10 streams of \texttt{charged} and \texttt{mixed} $B \bar B$ background,
\item 6 streams of $c \bar c$ (\texttt{charm}) and other $q \bar q$ (\texttt{uds}) background,
\item \texttt{ulnu} sample, corresponding to $20\times$ integrated luminosity of the full Belle dataset,
\item \texttt{rare} sample, corresponding to $50\times$ integrated luminosity of the full Belle dataset.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Control Fit}\label{sec:control-fit}
$B \bar B$ background composition in control region is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cs_bkg_after}. Due to the strict cut of the $m_{KK}$ around the $D^0$ mass window, most of the decays with a $D^0$ proceed via $D^0 \to K^+K^-$ decay. In this case, the following fit templates are chosen
\begin{itemize}
	\item signal template,
	\item $q \bar q$ template,
	\item $C_0:~B^+ \to \bar{D} {}^0 \ell^+ \nu,~D^0 \to K^-K^+$ (control decay),
	\item $C_1:~B \to \bar{D} {}^* \ell^+ \nu,~D^0 \to K^-K^+$,
	\item other $B \bar B$ BKG template.
\end{itemize}
In control fits, all template shapes are fixed and the yields of all templates are floated, except for the signal template, which is expected to be very close to zero and is fixed to the expected MC yield. Additionally, since the $C_0$ and $C_1$ decays are well known and measured, we make use of this fact in the form of a ratio $N_{C_1}/N_{C_0}$, which is fixed to the MC value in case of the MC fit and constrained to the measured value in case of fits to real data. The ratio is implemented based on the decay channels shown in Table \ref{tab:cs_constraint_table} and is defined as
\begin{equation}
r_1 = \frac{\left(\sum_j N_{1j}\times \rho_{1j} \right)}{N_{00} \times \rho_{00}},
\label{eq:cs_fix}
\end{equation}
where $j$ runs over all channels in the category $C_1$ and where $\rho_{ij}$ is the branching ratio correction factor for the specific channel $N_{ij}$, which incorporates information from world measurements. It is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\rho = \frac{\mathcal{B}^{PDG}}{\mathcal{B}^{GEN}}.
\label{eq:br_fix}
\end{equation}
The branching ratio correction factor has been implemented due to differences between measured and MC branching ratio values. Each branching ratio measurement serves as a constraint used in the fit. All branching ratio constraints in the control fit are shown in Table \ref{tab:cs_br_constraint_table}. The measured values are cited only for the $B^0$ decay mode, where isospin symmetry has been assumed. The corresponding $B^+$ branching ratios can be calculated as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}(B^+) = \mathcal{B}(B^0) \times \tau_{B^+/B^0},
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{B^+/B^0}$ is the ratio of $B$-meson decay times, which is measured to be [X]
\begin{equation}
\tau_{B^+/B^0} = 1.076 \pm 0.004.
\end{equation}

\end{table}

In case of MC fits, the fitted sample is also generated with MC, so $\mathcal{B}_{i}^{PDG} = \mathcal{B}_{i}^{MC}$ and Eq. (\ref{eq:cs_fix}) simplifies to a simple MC yield ratio. On fits to real data, expected MC yields and branching ratio measurements are implemented as independent Gaussian constraints in order to properly account for correlations in Eq. (\ref{eq:cs_fix}).

\subsubsection{Smearing and Offset Parameters}
With simulated data we are able to perform detailed studies prior to looking at measured data. However, simulated data often does not describe real data perfectly. Out of variables \vars, $\Delta E$ is especially prone to a lack of precision in energy measurements. This can introduce either overestimation of resolution on MC as well as a possible shift in the measured energy in either direction. Due to this fact, we perform a scan over two additional parameters of offset and smearing, applied on the $\Delta E$ variable. In case of the $M_{BC}$ variable the mentioned effects are not as prominent, so the smearing and offset for the latter variable are omitted. 

The following parameter phase space is scanned
\begin{itemize}
\item smearing factor in range $[0.0,0.08]\e{GeV}$ in steps of $8\E{-3}$,
\item offset in range $[0.0,0.003]\e{GeV}$ in steps of $1.5\E{-4}$,
\end{itemize}
where for each parameter pair the likelihood ratio test is performed to estimate the goodness of the fit. Figure \ref{fig:smearing_offset} shows the contour plot of the likelihood ratio $\lambda$, as defined in Eq. (\ref{eq:lr}), for 2 d.o.f., for MC (left) and data (right). The scan over MC serves the purpose of a consistency check, where we expect the best fit to occur in the phase space where neither smearing nor offset are applied. In case of data, we see that we obtain a better fit by introducing some level of smearing and offset. In neither of the cases the two parameters show any sign of significant correlation, so we treat them as independent parameters. The likelihood ratio test allows us to estimate the parameter values in the $1\sigma$ confidence interval, where we obtain the optimal parameter set
\begin{itemize}
\item Smearing: $40_{-17}^{+15}\e{MeV}$,
\item Offset: $6_{-6}^{+4.6}\e{MeV}$.
\end{itemize}
We apply this transformation to our MC samples in all cases when fitting real data.

\subsection{Signal Fit}\label{sec:templates-in-signal-fits}
The motivation for choice of signal fit templates comes from Figure \ref{fig:sig_bkg_all_after}. The following histogram templates were defined for the signal fits
\begin{itemize}
\item signal template,
\item $q \bar q$ template,
\item a series of well defined templates from $B \bar B$ background:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $C_0:~B^+ \to \bar{D} {}^0 \ell^+ \nu,~D^0 \to K^-K^+$ (control decay),
	\item $C_1:~B \to \bar{D} {}^* \ell^+ \nu,~D^0 \to K^-K^+$,
	\item $C_2:~B \to \bar{D} {}^{(*)} \ell^+ \nu,~D^0 \to K^-\pi^+$,
	\item $C_3:~B \to \bar{D} {}^{(*)} \ell^+ \nu,~D^0 \to K^-K^+\pi^0,~K^-\pi^+\pi^0$,
	\item $C_4:~B \to \bar{D} {}{(*)} \ell^+ \nu,~D^0 \to K^-\ell^+\nu$,
	\item $C_5:~B^0 \to D^{(*)-} \ell^+ \nu,~D^+ \to K^-K^+\pi^+,~K^-\pi^+\pi^+$,
	\item $C_6:~$ other $B \to \bar D {}^{(*)} \ell^+ \nu$ decays,
\end{itemize}
\item remaining $B \bar B$ background template.
\end{itemize}
As mentioned in Chapter \ref{sec:background-suppression}, the majority of the background comes from $B \bar B$ events. Various processes ($C_0$ to $C_6$) contribute to this background which are well known and measured, so we make use of these measurements by fixing their yields in MC fits and appropriately constraining them in real data fits. The remaining $B \bar B$ background is merged into a single template. In this case, the shape of all templates is fixed as well, while the yields are floated for all templates except for the constrained background templates. The yield constraints are based on the channels shown in Table \ref{tab:sig_constraint_table} and defined for each template category as 
\begin{equation}
Y_i = \eta_{\mathrm{norm.}} \times \frac{\left(\sum_j N_{ij}\times \rho_{ij} \right)}{\rho_{00}},
\label{eq:sig_fix}
\end{equation}
where $j$ runs over all channels in the category $C_i$ and where $\rho_{ij}$ is defined in Eq. (\ref{eq:br_fix}). The first factor, $\eta_{\mathrm{norm.}}$, serves as a normalization factor in order to scale the number of generated $B \bar B$ events to the number of $B \bar B$ events in measured data. We define it as
\begin{equation}
\eta_{\mathrm{norm.}} = \frac{N_{\mathrm{control}}^D}{N_{\mathrm{control}}^{MC}},
\end{equation}
where $N_{\mathrm{control}}^D$ and $N_{\mathrm{control}}^{MC}$ are control yields in the control fit for data and MC, respectively.

In addition to branching ratio constraints in Table \ref{tab:cs_br_constraint_table}, further constraints are defined in Table \ref{tab:sig_br_constraint_table} due to more decay channels. In case of the category $C_6$, we have no firm handle on the $D$ meson decay, therefore no correction for this branching ratio can be introduced, so we set a correction factor of $1$ with a $100\%$ error for the $D$ meson decay branching ratio.

\section{Adaptive binning algorithm}\label{sec:adaptive-binning-algorithm}

The fit templates contain areas of low statistics, which are populated with bins with zero content. This is a direct consequence of having a finite MC sample and represent a liability in ML fits. Due to low statistic in the edge regions, the locations of these empty bins can vary for the templates and the fitted sample. A problem occurs if all templates have an empty bin where the fitted sample does not. In the scope of ML fits, this effectively means that there are entries in bins where the probability of having them is $0$. We will call such bins \textit{problematic}, because in these cases the fit does not converge.

The ideal solution for this problem would be to increase the MC statistics. Since this is not an option, we pursue other solutions, such as decreasing the number of bins. While this solves the problem, the drawback of it is a decrease in the template resolution in densely populated regions, where good resolution is most needed. The optimal solution here seems to be a choice of variable bins, with fine binning in the densely populated regions and larger bins in the regions with low statistics.

We have devised an algorithm, which compares the templates and the fitted sample, and defines a variable binning so that there are no more problematic bins in the end. Figure \ref{fig:adapt} shows an example of how the procedure works. The algorithm takes an argument for the initial number of uniform bins in each dimension, and does the following
\begin{enumerate}
\item define uniform binning in both dimensions with the provided argument,
\item create a 2D histogram from MC templates with expected yields,
\item define an \textit{optimal} region, where most of the 2D integral is contained and where all bins have a non-zero content (this region does not change throughout the process),
\item compare the histograms for the expected and the fitted sample, find the problematic bins,
\item loop until all problematic bins disappear
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item find problematic bin, which is nearest to the maximum bin,
	\item change the binning from $N$ to $N-1$ from that bin and in the direction away from the maximum bin.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

	\label{fig:adapt}
\end{figure}

An additional problem occurs in the plotting of the fitted templates and the sample with variable binning. It would seem that RooFit does not take the bin widths into account when plotting, while everything works as expected for the fit itself. This was bypassed by extracting the fitted yields and applying them to templates and samples with uniform binning, which were then used for drawing.


%\subsubsection{Ratio constraint}
%
%Introducing a smearing and offset factor can lead to unphysical global minima in the negative log-likelihood, where we mold a single MC template to almost perfectly describe data, while other contributions are rejected by the fit. In order to bypass this problem, we fix the ratio between the  $B \to \bar D {}^* \ell \nu$ sample and the control sample to the expected MC value in case of the MC fit, and to a corrected expected MC value for the data fit, where the corrections to the appropriate measured branching ratios are applied. In the latter case the constraint is applied in the form of a Gaussian function with the mean at the calculated value and with the width according to the appropriately propagated error.
%
%The expected MC ratio and the corrected ratio are calculated as
%\begin{align}
%\eta_{MC} &= \frac{N^{MC}_{B \to \bar D {}^* \ell^+ \nu}}{N^{MC}_{\mathrm{control}}},\\
%\eta_{DATA} &= \frac{N^{MC}_{B^+ \to \bar D {}^{*0} \ell^+ \nu}\times \rho_{B^+ \to \bar D {}^{*0} \ell^+ \nu} + N^{MC}_{B^0 \to D^{*-} \ell^+ \nu}\times \rho_{B^0 \to D^{*-} \ell^+ \nu}}{N^{MC}_{\mathrm{control}}\times \rho_{B^+ \to \bar D {}^{0} \ell^+ \nu}},
%\label{eq:ratioData}
%\end{align}

%\subsection{Consistency of MVA cuts}
%
%Control sample fits allow us to check the behavior of optimized MVA cuts on MC as well as data and see if any of the MVA steps introduce a possible disagreement between the two. We compare control yields, their ratios and ratios of cut efficiencies (double ratios). The following cut scenarios are studied
%\begin{itemize}
%\item[(a)] final selection before any MVA step,
%\item[(b)] (a) + $BDT_{q\bar q}$ cut,
%\item[(c)] (a) + $uBDT_{B\bar B}$ cut,
%\item[(d)] (a) + $BDT_{q\bar q} + uBDT_{B\bar B}$ cut (final selection).
%\end{itemize}
%
%The same binning was chosen as in the case of signal MC fits. The results for control fit yields, their ratios and double ratios are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cs_fits}. The plot shows that yield ratios and cut efficiency ratios are consistent with $1$. This means that, for the control sample, data and MC are in agreement before as well as after applying the final selection cuts. This is an important check for the signal decay mode, since, this check serves as an argument that the final selection is not over-optimized to signal MC.

\section{Fit Results}
In this section we present the fir results of signal and control fits on MC as well as data, along with the control decay branching ratio measurement. We also show results of the signal fit on MC and data.

\subsection{Signal MC fit results}\label{sec:signal-mc-fit-results}

With the signal fit setup described in \ref{sec:templates-in-signal-fits}, we proceed to fit the 10 streams of MC. To compare both methods of $B \bar B$ bar suppression, two different samples were prepared and used in the fit. Since the choice of initial uniform binning is not obvious, we perform fits to all streams of MC for each initial binning choice in the range $N\times N,~N\in[4,30]$. Figure \ref{fig:sig_binning} shows the expected yield differences, pulls and fit significances for both final samples for each binning case. The difference between fitted an expected signal yield should be equal to 0 to ensure no bias is present in the fit, while the average pull distribution for each bin case should have a central value at 0, with a width of 1.  While both fit results seem to have no bias with respect to the binning choice, the pull distribution seems to be closer to the normal distribution and the significance of the fit better by $1\sigma$ in the case of the sample optimized with the uBDT classifier. This fixes our choice of the final selection. The binning in \vars~is chosen at the plateau of the significance, where also no bias is present, and is somewhere in the region of $20$ bins in each dimension.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

	\captionsetup{width=0.8\linewidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/sig_binning}

	\label{fig:sig_binning}
\end{figure}

For the chosen binning of $20 \times 20$ in \vars~we perform the 10 stream MC fits, where an average stream fit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sig_streamfit}, while all fit results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:sig_global}. All stream fit results were fitted with a 0th degree polynomial. The global result seems to describe the expected value in a precise manner, with the bias much smaller than the average statistical error. The normalized $\chi^2$ value with $10-1=9$ degrees of freedom of the global fit is $\chi^2_9 = 0.99$, while the average significance of the fits is around $3.57 \sigma$.

	\label{fig:sig_global}
\end{figure}

For the chosen final selection and fit procedure, toy MC pseudo-experiments were performed in order to confirm the behavior of the signal fit. The fit behavior is also checked as a function of the signal yield in the form of a linearity test. A detailed description of toy MC experiments is written in Section X.

\subsection{Control Fit Result}
With the control fit setup described in \ref{sec:control-fit}, we proceed to fit the control sample after the final selection for 10 streams of MC and 1 stream of data. An average stream fit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cs_fit_mc} for MC and Figure \ref{fig:cs_fit_data} for data, while all fit results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cs_global}, where all streams of MC were fitted with a 0th degree polynomial. The control fit results for split and joined lepton modes are shown in Table \ref{tab:cs_fit_yield}.

\subsection{Branching Ratio Measurement for Control Decay}

After acquiring the fit results on MC and data, we are able to determine the branching ratio of the control decay, which is defined as
\begin{align}
\mathcal{B}^{MC}_{\mathrm{control}} &= \frac{N^{\mathrm{MC}}_\mathrm{control} \times \epsilon_{MC}}{2N_{B\bar B}^{MC}},\\
\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{control}} &= \frac{N_\mathrm{control} \times \epsilon_{MC} \times \rho_{PID}}{2N_{B\bar B}},
\label{eq:br_data}
\end{align}
where $N^{\mathrm{MC}}_\mathrm{control}$ and $N_\mathrm{control}$ are yields of the control fit on MC and data, $\epsilon_{MC}$ is the MC efficiency of the control sample, $\rho_{PID}$ the PID correction factor, and $N_{B\bar B}^{MC}$ and $N_{B\bar B}$ are the numbers of $B \bar B$ meson pairs on MC and in data, respectively. The factor of 2 in the denominator comes from the fact that there are 2 $B$ mesons in each $B$ meson pair $(\times 1/2)$, where only about $50\%$ of the $B$ meson pairs are charged $B^+B^-$ meson pairs $(\times 2)$, and from the fact that we are interested in the branching ratio to the lepton final state of either $e$ or $\mu$, and not their sum $(\times 1/2)$.

The control sample efficiency was determined on a separate signal MC sample of the control decay, where we generated $5\E{6}$ $B^+ \bar B^-$ pairs, with one $B$ always decaying via $B^+ \to \bar D {}^0 \ell^+ \nu,~D^0 \to K^+K^-$. After applying the final selection, the full and split efficiencies with regard to the lepton final state were determined to be 
\begin{align*}
\epsilon_{MC} &= (8.89\pm 0.04)\E{-3},\\
\epsilon_{MC}^e &= (4.40\pm 0.03)\E{-3},\\
\epsilon_{MC}^\mu &= (4.49\pm 0.03)\E{-3},
\end{align*}
where the efficiency error was estimated based on a formula from \cite{paterno2004calculating}.
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon_{MC} = \frac{1}{N}\sqrt{n(1-\frac{n}{N})},
\end{equation*}
where $n$ is a subset of the full set $N$.

The PID correction factor is obtained by taking into account the known PID efficiency differences between data and MC. It is described in detail in X and is determined to be
\begin{equation*}
\rho_{PID} = 0.99\pm 0.02
\end{equation*}
for the $e$ and $\mu$ mode, as well both of them together.

The number of $B\bar B$ meson pairs can be counted on MC and has been measured for data [X]. The values are
\begin{align*}
&N_{B\bar B}^{MC} = 765.98\E{6},\\
&N_{B\bar B} = (771.58 \pm 10.56)\E{6}.
\end{align*}

Finally, we can determine the branching ratios based on the calculations in Eq. (\ref{eq:br_data}). The obtained values are shown in Table \ref{tab:br_result} and graphically shown in Figure \ref{fig:br_plot}, along with the MC generated value and the current PDG world average. Both MC and measured determination of the control decay branching ratio are in agreement with the expected and the world average values. One should note that the black error bars correspond to statistical uncertainty. Of all the systematic uncertainties, only the PID systematics are included in this results. Other contributions of systematics are not included, since this measurement is not the goal of our analysis.
