Lay summary is a short account of research targeted at a general
audience, i.e., its goal is to communicate the research results to a
non-specialist readership. It should fit in one page.\\[12pt]%
A lay summary provides a brief description of the research in a less
technical language. It should include 1) background of the study, 2)
rationale and methods, and 3) outcomes.\\[12pt]%
The following guidelines are recommended.\\%
a) Write it in every day English, using shot and clear sentences.\\%
b) The text should be ordered logically and flow naturally, i.e.,
ideas and concepts should introduced as needed.\\%
c) Everything here should be expressed in active
voice. Preferentially, in first person.\\%
d) Positive phrasing.\\%
e) Aims, objectives and results should be clearly stated.\\%
f) Whenever possible, provide every day examples.\\%
g) Use the appropriate tone. This summary's goal is to inform not to
entertain.
